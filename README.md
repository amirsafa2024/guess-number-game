# Number Guessing Game

A simple, fun, and interactive front-end only number guessing game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The game randomly selects a secret number between 1 and 20 (inclusive). You have **4 guesses** to find it. After each guess, you'll get feedback:

-   "Too high!" if your guess is higher than the secret number
-   "Too low!" if your guess is lower
-   "Congratulations! You win!" if you guess correctly

If you run out of guesses, the game reveals the secret number and you lose.

Perfect for beginners learning JavaScript or anyone looking for a quick browser game!
